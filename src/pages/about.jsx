                <section className="two">
                    We are a company that started in 2018. Having employees who have been working together in the industry for more than 15 years, we decided to start a company where we can continue building and designing both home and commercial properties that our customers can be proud of. Creative Concrete first started with small projects in the local area of Riverside, California. Today, we are proud to say that we have become one of the leading concrete design companies in the Inland Empire.
